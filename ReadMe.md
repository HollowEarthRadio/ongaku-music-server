Ongaku Music Server
===================

The Ongaku Music Server is a web-based music player inspired by Grooveshark.  I wrote this because I wanted to be able
to have a streaming music server that I controlled what music was available.  If you find this software useful, please fork
this project on github (https://github.com/teknomunk/ongaku-music-server).

Features
--------

* Play uploaded MP3 files in any browser that supports Flash and/or HTML 5 audio (via jPlayer)
* Edit common MP3 file tags in browser.
* Songs organized into artist and album playlists.
* Allow placeholders for songs that have no associated MP3.
* Plugin support for expanding functionality without modifying core code.
